__Open-Closed Priciple__ : It states that software entities should be open for extension and closed for modification.

Example : I have showed an example of __notification system__ where i have two types of notifications i.e SMS and EMAIL notification.
Now to add another type of notifiaction i don't have to modify the previous code , I just have to extend the previous code.
