__Problem Statement : Society management system__


Design a system for managing access and communication within a residential society. The system should handle interactions efficiently among different participants, including residents, security personnel, and visitors.

Requirements:

Access Management: Users should be able to allow or disallow entry of visitors through notifications or by sharing an OTP (One-Time Password).

Visitor Requests: There should be functionality to process visitor entry requests and manage communications related to these requests.

Announcements: The system should allow sending and receiving news or updates to users within the society.

Visitor Categories: The system should differentiate between regular and occasional visitors and handle their access accordingly.

Notifications: Users should receive notifications about visitor requests and announcements.

How It Works Together:
Visitor Requests Entry: A visitor initiates a request for entry, which is processed by the system.

Processing Requests: Notifications are sent to the relevant user about the visitor request. The user then decides whether to allow or disallow the visitorâ€™s entry.

Decision Making: The decision is communicated back to the system, which either grants or denies access to the visitor. Notifications are updated to reflect the outcome.

Handling Announcements: The system allows sending announcements to users, who receive these updates as notifications.
